Exoplanet detection using Machine Learning
â—¦	This project investigates the detection of exoplanets using machine learning, specifically employing the K-Nearest Neighbors 
(k-NN) algorithm to analyze light intensity data.  Utilizing  a  dataset  downloaded  from  Kaggle,  which includes  light  curves  
of  various  celestial  bodies,  we  focus on identifying patterns indicative of exoplanets. The k-NN model is trained on labeled 
data to distinguish between exoplanets and non-exoplanetary candidates  based on   fluctuations   in   light intensity.  Our fin-
dings demonstrate  that  K-NN  can  effectively enhance  classification accuracy,  providing  a  promising  avenue  for  future  research  in   exoplanet detection and  contributing   to   our understanding of planetary systems beyond our solar system.
